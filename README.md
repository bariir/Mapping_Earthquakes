# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of Mapping Earthquakes


The purpose of this project is to create different maps that show earthquake in relation to tectonic plates' location on the earth. Also, the team would like to see all earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.
Finally, they want to see the data on a third map.


## Tools and Software: 
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Leaflet, D3, Visual Studio Code 1.68.1, Git Bash to commit changes into GitHub Repository. 


# Results
Basil and Sadhana want to see dynamic mapping that shows earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth and earthquake magnitude that is greater than 4.5 on the map.
In addition, we have created a third map that has different background.
