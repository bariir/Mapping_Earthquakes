# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of Mapping Earthquakes


The purpose of this project is to create different maps that show earthquake in relation to tectonic plates' location on the earth. Also, the team would like to see all earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.
Finally, they want to see the data on a third map.


## Tools and Software: 
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Leaflet, D3, Visual Studio Code 1.68.1, Git Bash to commit changes into GitHub Repository. 


# Results
Basil and Sadhana want to see dynamic mapping that shows earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth and earthquake magnitude that is greater than 4.5 on the map.
In addition, we have created a third map that has different background.

# Summary

The team has created a dynamic mapping that leverages GeoJSON data from USGS that provides last 7 days earthquakes and major earthquakes with magnitude that is greater than 4.5. In addition,
we got past 7 days earthquakes, major earthquakes and tectonic plates boundaries data. Therefore, the map displays earthquakes including major earthquakes and tectonic plates in more accessible and easily understood visualization.
Below is the links to the data.
